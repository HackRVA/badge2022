# badge2022
RVASec Badge 2022 Firmware

# Initial Setup

There are two ways you can run the badge software:

1) You can build the badge software and run it on hardware. This is helpful when seeing how well something works on the
   badge itself.
2) You can build a simulator that can run the badge software on your computer. This is *usually* more helpful when
   developing an app, since debugging tools on your computer are more sophisticated and easier to set up.

They need a few different things in order to set yourself up to build and run the badge software.

In both cases, you will need **CMake**, which is a build system / build system generator. (Version 3.13 or higher)

## Building for Hardware

For more info, see the [Pico SDK README](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk).

When building the software for badge, you will need a *cross-compiler*. This takes code written on your computer and
compiles it into machine code for the badge. The compiler used is the ARM Embedded GCC compiler. 

This may be available in your package manager, or [here](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads).
If downloaded from the ARM site, you will need to take steps to add it to your `$PATH` or equivalent environment
variable. (If it works, when you open a new terminal window, the `arm-none-eabi-gcc` program can be run).

### Visual Studio Code Setup

There are various editors and plugins you can add to better support CMake. A common setup is using Visual Studio Code
with its CMake Tools plugin. (When you open the project folder with VS Code, it will suggest installing this plugin
automatically, which you should do.)

CMake Tools has a couple of additional concepts: Kits that define compilers it can find, 
and Variants that define build parameters. If you've installed the ARM Embedded GCC compiler, 
the plugin should be able to scan for kits and automatically find your cross-compiler (you'll see one named `arm-none-eabi`).

If using VS Code with CMake Tools, you'll be able to use the Pico Variant (alongside the Kit for
the embedded compiler). Make sure to pick both the Kit and Variant that correspond with each other! 
To switch Variants, you can click on the information icon in the blue bar the bottom of the VS code window. 
To switch Kits, you can click on the wrench icon in the same bar. 
Find more information on CMake Tools [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/blob/main/docs/README.md)

You will likely want to change the target from `[all]` in the same bar at the bottom to `[badge2022_c]`.

The build folder will be named `build-pico` if using the VS Code variants.


### Command Line Build

If not using an IDE or VS code, you can use the following command to set up the build:

`cmake -S . -B build/ -G "Unix Makefiles"`

or, if that's too hard to type or remember:

`./run_cmake.sh`

to configure the build. This generates a bunch of makefiles, and

`cd build && make` to build the firmware.

After this, the file to flash on the device is at `build/source/badge2022_c.uf2`.

You can clean the build by running `make clean`.

A note for Windows users: [This link](https://community.element14.com/products/raspberry-pi/b/blog/posts/working-with-the-raspberry-pi-pico-with-windows-and-c-c)
has a bunch of useful information for getting started and installing prerequisites. Note that you don't need to do the
`PICO_SDK_PATH` setting portion, and when running and building this repository, you will want to use "NMake Makefiles" 
instead of "Unix Makefiles" (unless you want to install and use `make` as well). 

## Flashing the Badge

You can flash the Pico by holding down the button on the Pico board (not the rotary switch button)
as you're plugging it in to USB. That will make it show up as a USB mass storage device. Then,
you can copy the file `build/source/badge2022_c.uf2` onto the mass storage device to flash it. The
Pico will boot your new firmware immediately.

You can use Ninja, if you like, as well. \(Specify `-G Ninja` instead of Makefiles in the `cmake` command.\)

## Building the Simulator

The simulator is intended to run on a Posix-y (that is, Linux or Mac) environment. Windows can build and run it, but
using Windows Subsystem for Linux if your Linux subsystem has a desktop environment set up.

But to build the simulator, you will need a C compiler for your computer, in addition to GTK2. The best way to install
GTK2 is probably through a package manager.

### Visual Studio Code Setup

If you're using VS Code with CMake Tools, you should be able to pick the Simulator Variant (alongside the Kit for
your local computer's compiler to build the simluator). Make sure to pick both the Kit and Variant that correspond 
 with each other!

The build folder will be named `build-simulator` if using the VS Code variants.

### Command Line Build

In a similar way to the hardware target, you can generate makefiles via CMake. Note that to make the simulator, there is
an extra flag that gets passed in:

`cmake -S . -B build_sim/ -DTARGET=SIMULATOR -G "Unix Makefiles"`

or, if that's too hard to type or remember:

`./run_cmake_sim.sh`

After which, you can `cd` into the `build_sim/` directory and run `make` to build the simulator target. The output
program is called `build_sim/source/badge2022_c`, which you can run.


## Off-Target Unit Tests

Off-target unit tests are run using CTest (part of CMake). The `test_key_value_storage` executable provides a template
that can be used.

## Generating Documentation

The code has doxygen-style comments that can be pulled out to an HTML site (or the other formats doxygen supports).
To generate it locally, you'll need `doxygen` and `graphviz` to be installed in your local environment. Once you do,
running `doxygen` in the `source` folder will create a folder called `docs` with the documentation output.

## Adding Your Own Apps

Apps are mostly contained within a single .c/.h file in the apps folder. Take a look at the comments inside the
`badge-app-template` files for help getting started.

# Current Status

The overall structure of the repository is:
* `CMakeLists.txt` in the root directory is the main project definition. It includes subdirectories to add files/
  modules to the build. `pico_sdk_import.cmake` is provided by the Pico SDK.
* Code for apps and games is in the `source/apps` folder.
* Code for an interactive terminal (which may or may not be useful after the main application is running) is the
  `source/cli` folder. To run the CLI, hold the D-Pad left button down as the badge is starting. The display will
  show noise, and if you connect to the serial terminal that shows up on your computer, you can enter commands.
* Code that depends on Pico interfaces is within `source/hal/*_rp2040.c` files, with a platform agnostic header in the 
  corresponding `source/hal/*.h` file. Code built for the simulator is in `source/hal/*_sim.c`.
* Generally helpful system code (main menus, screensavers, and the like) is in the `source/core` folder.
* Code for display buffers and drawing is in the `source/display` folder.

## What's working
